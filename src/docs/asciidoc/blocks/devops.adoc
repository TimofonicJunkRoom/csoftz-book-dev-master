= DevOps
The term DevOps is mapped to Development and Operations and it fits in a sense in the Agile Systems developmment.
An important part of DevOps is being able to explain to coworkers in your organization what DevOps is and what it isn't.
The faster you can get everyone aboard the DevOps train, the faster you can get to the part where you perform the actual technical 
implementation!

TODO Put the following
Some text is extracted from the book Practical DevOps by Joakim Verona, PacktPub Publishing.

== Introduction
DevOps is, by definition, a field that spans several disciplines. It is a field that is very practical and hands-on, but at the 
same time, you must understand both the technical background and the nontechnical cultural aspects. This book covers both the practical and 
soft skills required for a best-of-breed DevOps implementation in your organization.

The word _‘DevOps’_ is a combination of the words _‘development’_ and _‘operation’_. This wordplay already serves to give us a hint of the basic 
nature of the idea behind DevOps. It is a practice where collaboration between different disciplines of software development is encouraged.

The DevOps movement has its roots in Agile software development principles. The Agile Manifesto was written in 2001 by a number of individuals 
wanting to improve the then current status quo of system development and find new ways of working in the software development industry. 
(http://agilemanifesto.org).

In light of this, DevOps can be said to relate to the first principle, _‘Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.’_

DevOps, then, tends to emphasize that interactions between individuals are very important, and that technology might possibly assist in making these 
interactions happen and tear down the walls inside organizations. This might seem counterintuitive, given that the first principle favors interaction 
between people over tools, but my opinion is that any tool can have several effects when used. If we use the tools properly, they can facilitate 
all of the desired properties of an Agile workplace.

A very simple example might be the choice of systems used to report bugs. Quite often, development teams and quality assurance teams use 
different systems to handle tasks and bugs. This creates unnecessary friction between the teams and further separates them when they should 
really focus on working together instead. The operations team might, in turn, use a third system to handle requests for deployment to the 
organization's servers.

An engineer with a DevOps mindset, on the other hand, will immediately recognize all three systems as being workflow systems with similar properties. It 
should be possible for everyone in the three different teams to use the same system, perhaps tweaked to generate different views for the different roles. A 
further benefit would be smaller maintenance costs, since three systems are replaced by one.

Another core goal of DevOps is automation and Continuous Delivery. Simply put, automating repetitive and tedious tasks leaves more time for human 
interaction, where true value can be created.

== How fast is fast?

The turnaround for DevOps processes must be fast. We need to consider time to market in the larger perspective, and simply stay focused on our tasks 
in the smaller perspective. This line of thought is also held by the Continuous Delivery movement.

As with many things Agile, many of the ideas in DevOps and Continuous Delivery are in fact different names of the same basic concepts. There really isn't 
any contention between the two concepts; they are two sides of the same coin.

DevOps engineers work on making enterprise processes faster, more efficient, and more reliable. Repetitive manual labor, which is error prone, is removed 
whenever possible.

Another way to look at it is this: If you ever feel yourself losing focus because of needless waiting, something is wrong with your processes or your 
tooling. If you find yourself watching videos of robots shooting balloons during compile time, your compile times are too long!

The same is true for teams idling while waiting for deploys and so on. This idling is, of course, even more expensive than that of a single individual.

== The Agile wheel of wheels

There are several different cycles in Agile development, from the Portfolio level through to the Scrum and Kanban cycles and down to the Continuous 
Integration cycle. The emphasis on which cadence work happens in is a bit different depending on which Agile framework you are working with. Kanban 
emphasizes the 24-hour cycle and is popular in operations teams. Scrum cycles can be between two to four weeks and are often used by development teams 
using the Scrum Agile process. Longer cycles are also common and are called Program Increments, which span several Scrum Sprint cycles, in Scaled 
Agile Framework.

DevOps must be able to support all these cycles. This is quite natural given the central theme of DevOps: cooperation between disciplines in an Agile 
organization.

The most obvious and measurably concrete benefits of DevOps occur in the shorter cycles, which in turn make the longer cycles more efficient. Take care
of the pennies, and the pounds will take care of themselves, as the old adage goes.

Here are some examples of when DevOps can benefit Agile cycles:

* Deployment systems, maintained by DevOps engineers, make the deliveries at the end of Scrum cycles faster and more efficient. These can take place with 
a periodicity of two to four weeks.{zwsp} +
{zwsp} +
In organizations where deployments are done mostly by hand, the time to deploy can be several days. Organizations that have these inefficient deployment 
processes will benefit greatly from a DevOps mindset.

* The Kanban cycle is 24 hours, and it's therefore obvious that the deployment cycle needs to be much faster than that if we are to succeed with Kanban.{zwsp} +
{zwsp} +
A well-designed DevOps Continuous Delivery pipeline can deploy code from being committed to the code repository to production in the order of minutes, 
depending on the size of the change.

An example of a Continuous Delivery pipeline in a large organization is introduced in the following image:

== Architecture rules of thumb
There are a number of architecture rules that might help us understand how to deal with the way Monolith apps are deployed/modified.

=== The separation of concerns
The renowned Dutch computer scientist Edsger Dijkstra first mentioned his idea of how to organize thought efficiently in his paper from 1974, 
*_On the role of scientific thought_*.

He called this idea _‘the separation of concerns’_. To this date, it is arguably the single most important rule in software design. There are many other 
well-known rules, but many of them follow from the idea of the separation of concerns. The fundamental principle is simply that we should consider 
different aspects of a system separately.

==== The principle of cohesion
In computer science, cohesion refers to the degree to which the elements of a software module belong together.
Cohesion can be used as a measure of how strongly related the functions in a module are.
It is desirable to have strong cohesion in a module.
We can see that strong cohesion is another aspect of the principle of the separation of concerns.

=== Coupling
Coupling refers to the degree of dependency between two modules. We always want low coupling between modules.
Again, we can see coupling as another aspect of the principle of the separation of concerns.
Systems with high cohesion and low coupling would automatically have separation of concerns, and vice versa.

== Three-tier systems
Most of todays applications are built using the Three-tier pattern.

This software architecture pattern has been in use for decades and continues to be popular. These types of systems are very common, and it is quite 
likely that you will encounter them, either as legacy systems or as new designs.

In this figure, we can see the separation of concerns idea in action:

== Choosing a branching strategy
When working with code that deploys to servers, it is important to agree on a branching strategy across the organization.

A branching strategy is a convention, or a set of rules, that describes when branches are created, how they are to be named, what use branches should have, 
and so on.

Branching strategies are important when working together with other people and are, to a degree, less important when you are working on your own, but they 
still have a purpose.

Most source code management systems do not prescribe a particular branching strategy and neither does Git. The SCM simply gives you the base mechanics to 
perform branching.

With Git and other distributed version control systems, it is usually pretty cheap to work locally with feature branches. A feature, or topic, branch is a 
branch that is used to keep track of ongoing development regarding a particular feature, bug, and so on. This way, all changes in the code regarding the 
feature can be handled together.

There are many well-known branching strategies. Vincent Driessen formalized a branching strategy called Git flow, which has many good features. For some, 
Git flow is too complex, and in those cases, it can be scaled down. There are many such scaled-down models available. This is what Git flow looks like:
